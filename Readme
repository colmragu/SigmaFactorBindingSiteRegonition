Algorithm to recognize sigma factor binding sites.

Usage:
python SigmaFactorBindingSiteRegonition.py -sort Data/Mycoplasma_gallisepticum_CA06_2006_052_5_2P_uid172630/NC_018412.gbk Results/Mycoplasma_gallisepticum_CA06_2006_052_5_2P_uid172630.txt

Algorithm: 

1. For each gene in genbank file place it in a dict with the NCDNA proceeds it as the key.
2. For each element in NCDNA find all substrings that are common between it and any of the elements of the NCDNA set. 
3. If this element is grater than the minimul lenght requirment (minlen) add it to the set called commonsubstrings
4. If a common substring is repeated incremnt the count of that substring
5. Once all NCDNA elements have been compared with all others select only thoes that meet the minimum occurrances paramater (minoccurances)
6. print commonsubstring followed by genes whose ncdna contains that substring in order of occurrances.

Results: 

Some of the most common substrings across a gen bank file are already identified sigma factor binding sites. Example TTAAAA in Mycoplasma gallisepticum http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2258871/
